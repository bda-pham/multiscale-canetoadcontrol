# Multiscale modelling of invasive species control
This repository contains the NetLogo source code of a multiscale model in cane toad control, including a microscale model of toad movement and a macroscale model of toad spread in the Kimberley-Pilbara region, Australia. In addition to the code, necessary input files to run the macroscale model are located in macro-input directory. R scripts used for data processing and result analysis are also provided.

This model was produced as part of my thesis in Master of Computer Science at University of Melbourne.
